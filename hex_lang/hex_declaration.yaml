hex: # lake-root-level key intended to declare relations only (relations could be declared
     # in ttl-section too).

  # Sometimes it's more convenient to declare relations in one separated (from ttl objects
  # declarations) place.

  - obj10:   # source object (declared in ttl)
      obj11: # target object (declared in ttl)

  - obj12:          
      obj13: type   # target object (declared in ttl) and relation type

  - obj14:              # target object (declared in ttl)
      obj15: (<).type   # source object (declared in ttl) and relation type

  # These relations declarations are good to coexist with 'in-ttl' ones and matching rules
  # are the same:

  # Two  matched declarations treated as one.
  # Two or more relations matched by source, target and direction but label 
  # are getting warning.

  

  # Future releases:      # Relations could be declared in a 'fully unwind' or 'edges' manner.
                          # Next declaration is the same as previous one

                          # ---
                          # edges:
                          #   - source: obj15
                          #     target: obj14
                          #     label: type
